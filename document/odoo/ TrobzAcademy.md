    **Send a message:**
        - Send a message to all followers of the document via email and create a log.
        - If the recipients are not followers of the document, they will be automatically added to the follower list. 
        - Be careful: there is a chance that the customer is in the follower list, so if your message is a internal message try the log note feature instead. 
    **Log a note:**
        - Log a note for this document. No notification will be sent to any followers
